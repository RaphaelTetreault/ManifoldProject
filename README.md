# Manifold
Manifold is a suite of IO tools, visualizers, and editors built in the Unity Engine for modding games. Manifold focuses on asset mods and aims to facilitate managing and maintaining a database of game-specific assets.

The tool currently supports making rudimentary stages for the GameCube game F-Zero GX (all regions) and Triforce arcade game F-Zero AX.

## Support the project

This project is primarily developed by a single person. If you would like to show support for the project and help warrant the immense amount of time required to make these tools, please consider spreading the word and supporting me on Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/raphaelt.

## Community

For discussion around tools for F-Zero GX and F-Zero AX, I currently primarily use F-ZERO GX/AX Track Modding server, accessible here: https://discord.gg/Q2dThP9Y9D.
